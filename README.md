# Javascript-Loan-Calculator

Created a loan calculator, which takes the inputs from the user and calculates the monthly payment, the total interest and the total interest.
The requirement was to take the inputs and do all the validations necessary and write a dummy service, which can be called through the AJAX and get the sponsors if the user has entered the ZIPCode.
After the required payment amounts were calculated, a graph denoting the loan balance and interest payments are to be shown in the page.
